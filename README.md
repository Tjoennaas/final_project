 Final project.  OnlyArt.

This assignment is my Final Project/Exams of the year, where I aim to show what I learned troughout the past year. I have tried to put this new knowledge to use in making a WebGallery/ OnlineArtShop in which users can each create an own unique account, log in to their private separate space for uploading images. This is done as part of filling out a form, where uploading image is one, others will be Title, Size and Price for the uploaded Artwork. This will render on the web page as a Portfolio, as a first part of a bigger project -where I intend to make a fully functional ArtShop/WebGallery. I have made a function for searching for images by title, and also a filtersystem to filter by size and/or price and a SortBy-function that sort by price from low to high and vice versa. Next, I put in a Currency-API who allows user to choose from a list of currencies. 

I have used Firebase for making the registration of unique users accounts possible, and for storing users data. I chose to upload the images to the storage so that I wouldnâ€™t have to hardcode images in HTML, and thereby reduce the code.  
I have hosted my assignment, and stored the API-key in environmental variable on Netlify. About security, I have put the API-key in .env  so that its not visible for public, for inst on GitHub. 
Due to difficulties hosting on Netlify I had to change the structure of the file in my code, so you will notice my main branch on GitHub differ from the file you will receive on WiseFlow for my exam, I am aware of this but had to do so in order to get everything up and going.
The original plan was as mentioned to make an online Art Shop/ Web Gallery, but due to limited time I chose to make a fraction of this- which I also see as the most fundamental part of the imaginary complete project. The ArtShop would ideal contain both a seller- and a buyer side, with functions for purchase, communication etc.
